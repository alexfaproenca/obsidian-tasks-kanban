# Obsidian Tasks Kanban

A Kanban board view plugin for Obsidian that displays Tasks in a visual board layout.

> **How does this plugin compare to other Kanban ones?** See [Comparison](#comparison).

## Features

- **Kanban Board View**: Display your tasks in a Kanban-style board with a column per status
- **Multiple Saved Boards**: Define several named boards, each with its own query and columns; open each in its own tab
- **Base Query**: A shared query merged into every board, so common filters live in one place
- **Custom Columns**: Optionally replace the default status columns with your own, mapping each column to specific status symbols (e.g. split "In Progress" into "Ongoing" `/` and "In Review" `A`)
- **Grouping (Swimlanes)**: Group cards into foldable lanes by status, priority, tags, path, folder, or filename
- **Sorting**: Sort cards by priority or a date field, ascending or descending
- **Filtering**: Search bar for title and tags, plus full Tasks-style query editing
- **Drag & Drop**: Move tasks between columns to change their status
- **Tasks Integration**: Listens to Tasks plugin events for real-time updates
- **Task Format Aware**: Writes done/cancelled dates in whichever format Tasks' own **Task Format** setting specifies — emoji (`✅ 2026-08-04`) or Dataview (`[completion:: 2026-08-04]`)
- **Task Details Modal**: Click a card to open a full editor (title, status, priority, due date, Jira link, notes, image attachments) instead of jumping straight to the source file; use the modal's "Open source note" button, or Ctrl/Cmd+click a card, to jump to the note directly
- **Jira Linking**: Tag a task with a Jira issue key (e.g. `DIG-12345`); with a Jira base URL configured in settings, the card's badge opens the issue directly
- **Notes & Attachments**: Attach free-form notes and pasted/dropped screenshots to a task without touching its description — stored as plain Markdown next to your vault, not inside the plugin's settings file

## Installation

### From the Community Plugins listing (recommended)

1. Install the [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) plugin from Obsidian Community Plugins
2. Open **Settings → Community plugins → Browse**, search for **Tasks Kanban**, and click **Install** — or install directly from the [Community listing page](https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/tasks-kanban)
3. Enable both plugins in Obsidian Settings

### Manual installation

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Djiit/obsidian-tasks-kanban/releases/latest)
2. Copy them into your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/tasks-kanban/` folder
3. Reload Obsidian and enable both the Tasks and Tasks Kanban plugins in Settings

## Usage

### Opening a board

From the command palette:

- **Open board** — opens the default board
- **Open saved query…** — pick one of your saved boards to open
- **Open new blank board** — create a fresh board and start customizing it

Each board opens in its own tab; opening a board that's already open focuses its tab.

### Columns

By default the board shows one column per status type (Todo, In Progress, Done, Cancelled), derived from your Tasks status configuration.

You can instead define **custom columns** per board in Settings. Each custom column is a partition over status symbols — pick which statuses it collects, and the first one becomes the symbol written when you drop a card into it. This lets you, for example, split "In Progress" into separate "Ongoing" (`/`) and "In Review" (`A`) columns.

### Saved boards and the base query

A board's view is defined by a **query** (filters + sort + grouping) and its **columns**. In Settings you can:

- Edit the **base query**, merged on top of every board
- Add, rename, and delete **saved boards**, each with its own query and columns

Inline edits from a board's search/sort/group bars are saved back to that board.

### Filtering, sorting, and grouping

The board supports a subset of Tasks query syntax. For complete documentation, see [Query Syntax](docs/query-syntax.md).

**Filtering:**
- `tag includes #<tag>` — show tasks with the specified tag
- `description includes <text>` — show tasks whose description contains the text

**Sorting:**
- `sort by <field>` / `sort by <field> reverse`
- Fields: `due`, `scheduled`, `start`, `created`, `priority`

**Grouping** (into foldable swimlanes):
- `group by <field>` / `group by <field> reverse`
- Fields: `status`, `priority`, `tags`, `path`, `folder`, `filename`

Date-based grouping is intentionally not offered, since one lane per distinct date scatters the board.

The search and sort/group bars above the board edit the same query visually; the filter button opens the raw query editor.

### Drag & Drop

- Drag a task card from one column and drop it on another to change its status
- The dropped card takes the target column's status symbol
- The source file is updated and the board refreshes to show the new status

## Comparison

The key difference between Kanban plugins is *what a card is* — and, when cards are tasks, *where the task data comes from*:

| Plugin | Cards are… | Built on |
|--------|------------|----------|
| [Kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban) | **notes** — a board is its own note, each card a line of Markdown living only on that board | self-contained board note |
| [Kanban Bases View](https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/kanban-bases-view) | **notes** — one card per note, columns from a frontmatter/Base property | [Obsidian Bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases) |
| [Task Board](https://github.com/tu2-atmanand/Task-Board) | **tasks** — checkbox lines scanned from across your vault | its own task scanner (reads Tasks-compatible formats, but parses independently) |
| **Tasks Kanban** (this) | **tasks** — cards *are* your real tasks, wherever they already live in your vault | [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) |

Because this plugin is built on Tasks, the board is a **live view over your existing tasks** (filtered, sorted, grouped) rather than a separate copy to keep in sync. Move a card and it rewrites the task's status in its source file. It reuses the Tasks plugin's own parser and query engine, so your tasks behave consistently between Tasks queries and the board.

Choose this if your work already lives as `- [ ]` tasks scattered across your notes and you already use Tasks; choose [Task Board](https://github.com/tu2-atmanand/Task-Board) if you want a task board without depending on the Tasks plugin; choose a note-based board if you'd rather each card be a whole note.

## Development

### Building

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production (minified)
npm run build
```

### Development Commands (Obsidian CLI)

Use the [Obsidian CLI](https://help.obsidian.md/cli) for faster development:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `obsidian plugin:reload id=obsidian-tasks-kanban` | Reload plugin without restarting Obsidian |
| `obsidian dev:errors` | Check for plugin errors |
| `obsidian dev:console level=error` | View console errors |
| `obsidian dev:screenshot path=screenshot.png` | Capture current view |
| `obsidian dev:dom selector=".workspace-leaf"` | Inspect DOM elements |
| `obsidian dev:css selector=".workspace-leaf" prop=background-color` | Check CSS values |
| `obsidian dev:mobile on` | Enable mobile emulation |
| `obsidian eval code="app.plugins.getPlugin('obsidian-tasks-kanban')"` | Access plugin instance |

### Quick Development Cycle

```bash
# In one terminal: watch for changes
npm run dev

# In another terminal or Obsidian CLI: reload after changes
npm run dev:reload

# Or use the full cycle
npm run dev:full
```

### Testing

Tests use Vitest with JSDom environment. Test files are in the `tests/` directory.

```bash
npm test        # Run all tests once
npm run test:watch  # Watch mode for development
```

### Type Checking

```bash
npm run typecheck   # Type-check without emitting output
```

### Git Hooks

[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) hooks are installed automatically on
`npm install` (via the `prepare` script):

- **pre-commit**: runs `lint-staged` (ESLint + Prettier on staged files) followed
  by `npm run typecheck`.
- **commit-msg**: validates the message with [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/)
  against the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) spec.
